# What is $ARGUS

$ARGUS is the native governance and utility token of the ARGUS ecosystem. It serves as the backbone of the ecosystem, aligning incentives around security, adoption, and long-term protocol development.

## Overview

- **Ecosystem Alignment**: Incentivizes long-term participation

## The ARGUS Foundation

The ARGUS Foundation exists to ensure ARGUS remains:

- **Open**: Transparent development and decision-making
- **Non-Custodial**: User sovereignty is never compromised

## Governance Model

### Proposal Process

### Voting Mechanism

- **One Token, One Vote**: Each $ARGUS token equals one vote
- **Staking Multiplier**: Staked tokens have increased voting power
- **Quorum Requirements**: Minimum participation required for validity
- **Time-Locked Execution**: Approved proposals have execution delays for security

### Governance Areas

**Protocol Governance**:
- Security parameter changes
- Feature additions and removals
- Integration approvals
- Upgrade decisions

**Foundation Governance**:

- Partnership decisions
- Team composition

## Staking Mechanism

### How Staking Works

1. **Lock Tokens**: Lock $ARGUS tokens in staking contract
2. **Earn Rewards**: Receive staking rewards over time
3. **Increased Voting Power**: Staked tokens have more voting weight
4. **Unlock**: Unlock tokens after staking period (with cooldown)

### Staking Benefits

- **Rewards**: Earn $ARGUS tokens for staking
- **Governance**: Increased voting power
- **Security**: Help secure the network
- **Long-Term Alignment**: Incentivizes holding

### Staking Risks

- **Lock Period**: Tokens are locked during staking period
- **Slashing**: Potential penalties for malicious behavior (if implemented)
- **Market Risk**: Token value can fluctuate

## Token Economics

### Supply Model

$ARGUS uses a controlled supply model:

- **Total Supply**: Fixed or controlled inflation
- **Distribution**: Gradual release over time
- **Burning**: Potential token burning mechanisms
- **Utility**: Demand driven by ecosystem usage

### Value Drivers

$ARGUS value is driven by:

- **Ecosystem Growth**: More users = more demand
- **Governance Participation**: Active governance increases value
- **Staking Rewards**: Attractive rewards drive staking
- **Utility**: Premium features and discounts create demand
- **Security**: Strong security attracts users and value

## Roadmap Integration

$ARGUS token is integrated into the ARGUS roadmap:

- **Phase 1**: Initial distribution and governance setup
- **Phase 2**: Staking and rewards launch
- **Phase 3**: Advanced governance features
- **Phase 4**: Full ecosystem integration
