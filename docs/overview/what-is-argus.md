# What is ARGUS

Every crypto wallet begins and ends with a single private key.

And that is the fundamental problem.

Lose it, leak it, sign one malicious transaction, or expose it through malware, phishing, or social engineering — and your assets are gone permanently. Traditional self-custody wallets place absolute trust in a single secret, offering no fallback, no contextual checks, and no second line of defense.

Once the key is compromised, the system has no way to ask **who**, **where**, or **how** a transaction is being approved.

**ARGUS changes this model entirely.**

ARGUS is a next-generation self-custody wallet that replaces single-key trust with **environment-based security**. Instead of trusting a private key alone, ARGUS verifies *real-world context* before allowing any sensitive transaction to execute.

ARGUS allows every user — not just institutions — to protect their assets using customizable, multi-layer security:

- Geolocation verification
- Voice biometrics
- Hardware keys (USB)
- Trusted Bluetooth devices
- Network & device checks
- On-chain multisig approval

Each layer acts as an independent lock.

You decide how many locks exist.

You decide what conditions must be met.

You decide what it takes for your vault to open.

Security is no longer twelve words written on paper.

It becomes **physical**, **personal**, **dynamic**, and **resilient**.

This is security beyond the basics.

This is **ARGUS**.

## ARGUS Is a Wallet — Built on Invisible Multisig

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center', margin: '2rem 0', borderRadius: '12px', overflow: 'hidden'}}>
  <img src="/img/wallet_showing.jpg" alt="ARGUS Wallet" style={{width: '100%', maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto', borderRadius: '12px'}} />
</div>

ARGUS is designed to feel like a normal wallet.

You can send, receive, hold tokens, interact with dApps, and manage your assets exactly as you would with any standard Solana wallet.

Under the hood, however, ARGUS wraps every secure vault in an **on-chain multisig architecture powered by Squads Protocol V4**.

This multisig is not exposed to the user.

There is no multisig UI.

No coordination overhead.

No institutional complexity.

ARGUS abstracts the multisig completely and presents it as a simple wallet experience — **multisig for retail users**, applied automatically and enforced on-chain.

The result is a wallet that behaves like a hot wallet but defends itself like institutional infrastructure.

## Why ARGUS Matters

ARGUS is not trying to replace cold storage.

Cold wallets remain the best option for long-term, inactive holdings.

ARGUS exists to secure the reality that **hot wallets still exist** — and they are the primary attack surface in crypto today.

ARGUS gives hot wallets institutional-grade protections without institutional friction.

- Multisig without complexity
- 2FA without reliance on SMS
- Physical security without custodian risk
- Strong guarantees without giving up sovereignty

## Open Beta & ARGUS Wallet v1.0.1

ARGUS Wallet v1.0.1 marks the beginning of the Open Beta.

This release includes:

- Fully functional Argus Vault creation
- Geo-fenced transaction approvals
- Secure multisig enforcement via Squads V4
- Real-world testing readiness

The coming iterations will expand ARGUS into the most advanced self-custody security system in crypto, adding deeper environmental verification layers and recovery primitives.

We are listening closely, refining aggressively, and building in public.

## The ARGUS Foundation & $ARGUS

The ARGUS ecosystem is backed by the **ARGUS Foundation**, launched alongside the wallet and the $ARGUS token.

$ARGUS serves as the backbone of the ecosystem, aligning incentives around security, adoption, and long-term protocol development.

The foundation exists to ensure ARGUS remains:

- Open
- Non-custodial
- Community-driven
- Security-first by design

## Key Features

### Multi-Layered Security

Five independent security layers work together to protect your assets. Even if one layer is compromised, your funds remain secure.

### Geographic Fencing

Transactions can only be approved from specific physical locations that you define. This prevents remote attacks even if your private key is compromised.

### Voice Authentication

Your unique voice print serves as a biometric signature. Advanced audio analysis ensures only you can approve transactions.

### Squads V4 Integration

Built on Solana's premier multisig infrastructure, providing on-chain security guarantees that exist independently of ARGUS infrastructure.

### Full Token Support

- Native Solana (SOL) support
- All SPL tokens
- ARGUS governance token ($ARGUS)
- Real-time price tracking via Jupiter

### Integrated Swapping

Powered by Jupiter Aggregator, get the best prices across 20+ DEXes directly in your wallet.

### Fiat On-Ramp

Buy crypto with credit cards, Apple Pay, or Google Pay through MoonPay integration.

### Multi-Language Support

Available in English, Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and Portuguese.

## Security Guarantees

Even if an attacker obtains your private key, they **cannot** drain your Argus Vault funds without:

- Replicating your voice biometrics
- Being physically present at your registered location
- Possessing your registered hardware security key
- Having access to your registered Bluetooth device
- Bypassing your platform biometric authentication

This multi-layered approach creates defense-in-depth that makes unauthorized access virtually impossible.
